One sub-topic that was considered when developing CyberStrike Education was the players previous gaming experience. An initial survey had been conducted to gather data regarding the respondents previous gaming experience and how it impacts there current gaming preferences, to develop this educational game to achieve higher engagement. Those gaming mechanics that overlapped with all player types (i.e. players with different gaming experience, categorized as either "casual", "core" or "hardcore" gamers) current gaming preferences were identified alongside their awareness to basic cybersecurity topics. This data was then implemented into the game prototype, were the a pre and post game survey was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the game is raising cybersecurity awareness to all player types. 

The results of the game surveys indicated an overall positive increase of cybersecurity awareness and knowledge for all player types had increased after playing the game with slight variances due to misleading wording of cybersecurity questions in the game or inability to understand each players previous cybersecurity knowledge. The gaming mechanics implemented provided a solid foundation for future developers when designing an educational game that engages with all players regardless of their gaming experience.
